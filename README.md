# paperplane
A game statistics bot made for Discord during the Hack week event!

Here's a link to invite paperplane to your server: https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=592772110590541873&permissions=52224&scope=bot
And a fancy link to our website: https://paperplane.farkasdev.com

Don't feel like using the hosted version and want to self host it? No problem, you'll need some things though:
* A bot Token
* A support server with a invite code
* An API key from these sites:
https://developer.clashroyale.com/
https://tracker.gg/developers
https://developer.riotgames.com/
https://www.bungie.net/en/Application
* A user agent for the destiny API that follows the format found here: https://github.com/Bungie-net/api#are-there-any-restrictions-on-the-api
* Postgres to store custom prefixes
* The dependencies found in the ``requirements.txt`` files needs to be installed.
Once you have that you can edit the config.yml file in the bot folder and fill it up with all the neato API keys and etc.
